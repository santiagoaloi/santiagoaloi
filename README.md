## Howdy Nerds ðŸ––

I love building things, I'm a creative and  curious human. 

I help other developers by coming up with template projects, boilerplates, tutorials, contributing to open source and being active in the community as much as possible [ mainly Vue and Vuetify ]. I'm also a network engineer and cyber security consultant, in the field of log management, automation and machine learning.
